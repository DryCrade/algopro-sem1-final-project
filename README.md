👾 -- Tetris Remake -- 👾
=

This project is aimed to recreate on of the most popular and timeless game of all time - Tetris!
In this project, we will be dealing with an OOP-based program, which means classes, modules, and functions will play a huge part in this program.

Controls:
-

w or ↑ = rotate

a or ← = move left

d or → = move right

s or ↓ = speed up (trigger fast animation)

esc = quit game

A full file documentation can be found on 'Dennis William AlgoPro Final Project Report' PDF, which can be found in the repository.

This project is also hugely inspired by these YouTube tutorials:
